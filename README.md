# Machine-Learning-Classification

This repository contains the R code for machine learning classification, where different classifiers are built and compared on the glass dataset. The script performs data preprocessing, partitions the data into training and testing sets, and fits multiple modelsâ€”including logistic regression (with all variables and a reduced set), KNN, decision tree, and linear discriminant analysis. ROC curves and AUC values are computed to evaluate the performance of each classifier, with a special focus on classifying headlamps (glass type 7) against all other types.

All work and code serve as an educational resource and are not intended as a substitute for assignments. This repository is designed for those interested in exploring statistical methods and machine learning in a structured and formal environment.
