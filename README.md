# Machine-Learning-Classification
R code that builds and compares classifiers on the glass dataset. It preprocesses data, partitions it into training/testing sets, and fits logistic regression (full and reduced), KNN, decision tree, and LDA models. ROC curves and AUC values are computed, focusing on classifying headlamps (glass type 7) versus others.
